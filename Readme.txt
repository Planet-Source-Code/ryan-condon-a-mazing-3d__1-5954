This is a program i made because i was bored and wanted to see if i could do it, it took about a couple weeks of hard work and a lot of thinking, i'm not even close to a great programer so you'll have to deal w/ all my mistakes i made, there are little things that i haven't fixed yet. To make this maze was very easy, the only real hard part i had was to fill the colors in i had to use a dll for that, thats why you need gui32.dll to us this game, if anyone knows a different way w/o using a dll email, i'd love to find out, i looked on the internet for a long time to find out how to do it.

To play this game you use the arrow keys in pretty self explanitory i think, there are a couple options to choose the maze you want to play or to record and play a game, don't ask me why i put it in, i just felt like it. When you finish the maze depeneding on if the maze has one, it will tell you the password so you may open the maze in the maze editor to see this, this option is if you don't want people to see the maze you made and figure out how to beat it. They must beat the maze in order to see it. There are also secrets i guess you could call them, they are spaces that look like walls but you can walk through them, may get you to the finish faster! The Finsh is a black opening in the wall.

The Maze Maker is something i made so that i could make my mazes, its not that complicated to use but i tdoes take up 400 picture boxs so it might not load on all computers, if someone has a better way let me know. But the only rule about making the maze is that don't have a 4 open spaces make up a box it doesn't come out right in the maze sorry, maybe i'll fix it later. Put a password in the text box if you want it, if you don't thats fine. To save the file differently put the file name you want. Then to play it just load the game and go to options and select the name of you maze. 

Feel free to modify the game but if you do could you send me a copy i just want to see what you did, thank you! If you have any questions comments or have any suggestions to make it better please let me know(KingBeeXC@hotmail.com) Make it better if you can and send me a copy, i tried to put some comments in when i was done hopefully they can help you understand the program a little, but they aren't very good, sorry. 

Thank you, hope you like it
